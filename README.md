# Telecom-Churn

Business problem overview

In the telecom industry, customers can choose from multiple service providers and frequently switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. Given that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has become even more important than customer acquisition. For many incumbent operators, retaining highly profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of leaving. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data from a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and determine the main indicators of churn.

 

Understanding and defining churn

There are two main payment models in the telecom industry: postpaid and prepaid. In the postpaid model, customers pay a monthly or annual bill after using the services. In the prepaid model, customers pay or recharge with a certain amount in advance and then use the services.

In the postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, making it clear that this is an instance of churn. However, in the prepaid model, customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice. This makes it difficult to determine whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily (e.g., someone may be on a trip abroad for a month or two and then intend to resume using the services).

Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical and complex for prepaid customers, and the term ‘churn’ should be defined carefully. Additionally, prepaid is the most common model in India and Southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe and North America.

 

This project is based on the Indian and Southeast Asian market.
